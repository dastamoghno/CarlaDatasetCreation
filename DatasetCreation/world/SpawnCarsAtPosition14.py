    branch whose heading bends least, so we ride the corridor's natural approach
    (which may legitimately leave road 10 onto a connecting road for eastbound, or
    curve north for westbound) instead of turning onto a cross street. A spawn point
    is kept only when, walking FORWARD from it, the straightest route actually
    re-enters the radar zone (comes within ``reach_m`` of a radar). Direction
    (eastbound/westbound) is read from the travel heading at the closest approach to
    the corridor centre, so it is robust to curved approaches.

    With ``return_directions=True`` returns ``(transforms, dirs)`` where ``dirs[i]``
    is ``"E"`` or ``"W"``; otherwise returns just the transform list.
